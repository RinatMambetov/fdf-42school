This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.<br>
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For
example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a
prerequisite condition to its conquest.<br>
As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic
activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution, and as
a result, be better prepared.<br>
Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize some 3D magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not.<br>
